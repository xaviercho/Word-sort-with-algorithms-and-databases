The purpose of this study is to describe straight gay and bisexual mens
experiences with pornography The focus is mens use of pornography concurrent
with masturbation and or sexual activity with a partner The data were gathered
through in depth qualitative interviews that covered mens understandings of their own
practices with pornography
Kimmel and Linders mark the decontextual ization of pornography use
studying pornography in a laboratory for example  rather than as it is use  in the
privacy of ones home   or in a peepshow booth as one of the central pitfalls of social
science literature on pornography  As the word play in the title of this study indicates
the focus is on the private contexts of pornography use  the  private eyes that view
pornography  the  private selves  that experience it  and lastly  the tensions of the
 private investigator   having used pornography myself since early adolescence
inevitably investigating my own private i s while investigating those of others
Four central questions organize the body of this work  Is pornography use a
normative sexual practice in some men s lives    What is the relationship  if any  of
pornography to mens sexual fantasies To what extent is pornography involved with
mens experience of power How  if at ail  have men negotiated the use of
pornography while involved in longterm intimate relationships This study is not
designed to find a singular truth or theory of men and pornography  unless that truth is
the existence of a multiplicity of experiences The voices interpreted herein are nuanced

and tensionpacked each incorporating to some extent the conflicts and pleasures which
are part and parcel of virtually all sexual practices in our current social order
The study has been designed to le t the hypothesis that current discourse and
research on pornography does not represent mens experiences of pornography The
pornography controversy has generated a massive literature by any standard Scholars
activists and politicians have looked at pornography and theorized Brod

been no serious attempt to talk to men in detail  to understand  in die classic Weberian
 sense of Verstehen  what pornography means to them and the roles they see it
playing in their lives  The only works that come close are Winick and Hardy
 Winick  interviewed porn fans for the  Commission on Obscenity
and Pornography  Thai report addresses some important issues which will be discussed
later  but besides being sorely out of date it is lacking in detail as the researcher did
not identify himself as such  The interview was therefore masked as a one time casual
conversation  Hardy s study is limited m a number of basic ways  and a more
detailed critique of his work appears later in this chapter Briefly  however  Hardy is
primarily interested in the problematics of heterosexual desire so his sample of  men
includes no bisexuals or gays Furthermore  the study was conducted in Britain where
hardcore pornography is prohibited  thus  it addresses only softcore pornographic writing
It is questionably applicable to U S  fans Finally  Hardy is cnpplingly conservative
about gender and sexuality He repeatedly insists  despite a great deal of evidence  that
women do not like and do not produce pornography
Plainly  there has been much discussion of pornography  yet few attempts to
understand what men are really doing when they masturbate with pornography  What
is more the strongest voices at present are those of condemnation  in particular 
government commissions  policies and anti pornography feminists  Indeed  my
interviews indicate that such stereotypes as the trench  coated lonely man at the
pornography house are alive and well  Pornography and men are still shrouded in a
son of ironic mystery  continually talked about  yet continually unknown HOne of the

central goals of the study is so demystify and debunk mens experience of pornography
and to document what  believe to be die difference and variety of experiences among
these men Thus it was conducted with focused openended indepth qualitative
interviews with men who answered advertisements requesting participation in research
on pornography
One of the studys guides is profeminist mens studies The mens studies
approach though in its fledgling stages promotes the study of men selfconsciously as
men Men are no longer the objective representatives of humanity Brod b they
are gendered actors acting within the frame of masculine agendas By definition then
mens identification with or resistance to particular masculinities and the social
construction of those masculinities become the central focus of any study of men Like
womens studies before it the purpose of mens studies is to reveal aspects of history
and experience that have previously been hidden from study History hidden not
because of secondclass status as in the case of women but precisely because of mens
firstclass status As firstclass citizens as the nonOther as the writers of history
and social science men have unselfconsciously cast themselves as normative never
looking critically at their own actions as constructed upon masculine gendered
premises and interests The effort of mens studies is not to steal the limelight from
feminism but to participate in the feminist project of deconstructing the masculine
monolith As Harry Brod b points out special studies of men which are focused
on decentering Hmen are necessary in order to remove women from the status of
other

Although pornography is often thought of as a womens issue it is in many
respects a critical mens issue On one level it is the ultimate mens club  At the
same time mens discussion of pornography amounts to nothing more than a
deafening silence Kimmei b p  Mens silence is not always about
inarticulateness however it can very well be about maintenance of power Sane
 Mens silence sustains unquestioned the commercial juggernaut that is
pornography The silence of pornography fans contrasts with coundess dollars spent
and massive capital invested Men and pornography structural power on one hand
individual silences on the other Silences Kimmei b hypothesizes perhaps
guilty frightened angry maybe bored Silences that nonetheless reflect what is at the
heart of pornography one of the most basic sociological issues the relationship
between social structure and individual What is mens take on this practice so deeply
individualistic private yet so fundamentally informed by social power
Before we can really discuss men and pornography however a discussion of
definition and the multitude of positions is necessary Definitional debates are common
in the pornography discourse My definition draws on Robert Stollers Pornography
is that product manufactured with the intent to produce erotic excitement  p
 For the purposes of this project pornography is thus defined quite widely to
include triple X aka hardcore film and magazines as well as pulp magazines such
as True Detective which although not sexually explicit focus almost exclusively on
sexually violent reailife police stories Dietz et al  I do not accept
however Stollers assertion that ail sexual excitement entails hostility While hostility
is often present in sexual excitement it is not necessary to it

To further complicate our understanding we might think of pornography as
pornographies Although I will use this tom only intermittently in this dissertation
because of its awkwardness it is an important conceptual tool that deserves elaboration
Susan Sontag  first used the term to distinguish between pornography in social
history as a psychological phenomenon and as a minor convention in the arts Within
the current debates however this term takes on greater significance In addition to
clearly emphasizing the differences among types of pornographies the term has three
major advantages First it moves beyond simplifying and obscuring dualisms good
sexbad sex pornographyerotica Steinem  Second it can maintain the
distinction between violent and nonviolent pornographies but also complicate it For
example violent pornographies may include those which represent real violence that is
coercive real violence that is consensual and fictional violence performed by actors
Furthermore the sexually violent content in Rrated films see Donnerstein etai
 and especially Palys  has pornographic components under my definition
but not under the definitions of Dworkin and MacKinnon  or Steinem 
Finally this term enables us to recognize the similarities between mass market fiction
for example and more typical pornographies Snitow 
Beyond definitional debates there are a number of positions within the
pornography debate as a whole I have generalized them into six  conservative
emphasizes control of sexuality and stronger enforcement of obscenity laws Attorney
Generals Commission on Pornography   liberal emphasizes Fust
Amendment rights ACLU a b  feminists against pornography emphasizes
pornography as the central site of mens power and womens powerlessness this
R e p ro d u c e d with perm ission of th e copyright ow ner F u rth er reproduction prohibited without perm ission

position also emphasizes pornography as a violation of womens civil rights Dworkin
 MacKinnon   feminists against censorship emphasizes sexual
pluralism womens stake in sexual freedom this position argues that more control of
sexuality means more control over women Snhow Stansell and Thompson  Ellis
et al   gay male emphasizes pornography as an affirmation of gay sexuality
in a sexually oppressive as opposed to repressive society Bronski  Burger
 Preston   marxist emphasizes pornography as a compensation for mens
powerlessness in the labor market Soble  Although these categories do not do
justice to all work on pornography believe that they represent at least ideologically
the major positions in the current debate on pornography
The position that is missing is one that recognizes pornography as a form of
popular cultural production As studies of audiences of other popular cultural forms
see Hay et al  Rad way   this project studies the male audience of
pornography Typical terms for these men are porn consumers Segal  and
more often pom users see lensen b OToole  Consumers directs
attention to pornography in the market place and away from personal meaning and
masturbation The laner is problematic because of its stigmatizing connotation with
drug user Furthermore user implies that pornography is nothing more than a
masturbation aid I prefer Winicks  term pornography fan He does not
explain this choice but while effectively sidestepping the problems above the term
points towards the study of an audience and implies a commonplace and rich
involvement in foe varied practices of popular culture Just as a devoted baseball fan
does not simply watch the game but knows all about foe teams and players so it is with
R e p ro d u c e d with perm ission of th e copyright ow ner F u rth er reproduction prohibited without perm ission

pornography fans Perhaps most important however is that this is the word that fens
use for themselves The men I interviewed had extensive knowledge and informed
opinions about directors films and videos authors stars photographers magazines
political battles historical periods and styles trends and controversies in the industry
guide books and cultural leaders eg Susie Bright Pat Califia Larry Hint Al
Goldstein Candida Royalle Annie Sprinkle The culture of pornography entails
knowledge of fetishes sex toys eg buttplugs cock rings strapons and the language
of pornographic production eg the reverse cowgirt and DP sexual positions an
ECU camera shot the pussy light There are industry conventions attended by
stars and many fens see McElroy  When stars go on the road touring strip
clubs to promote their videos a very common practice fen clubs which all popular
stars have inform fans of dates and venues At the clubs stars meet fans pose for
pictures with them and give autographs Although not all the men I interviewed had
all this knowledge a few had more there was always a sense of shared knowledge a
common language of the pornography world Although this project will not focus on
the wider pornography culture described here this specialized knowledge was vital to
my interviews and adds a specifically sociological context from which we can begin to
understand the men in my sample
There is a stigma for porn fans however that does not exist for fens of most
popular culture A more accurate comparison is the audience of romance novels who
are also stigmatized Radway  Indeed Radway argues that one central aspect
of the stigma attached to romance novels is their sometimes softcore pornographic
content I will draw a number of parallels between Radways romance readers and the
R e p ro d u c e d with perm ission of th e copyright ow ner F u rth er reproduction prohibited without perm ission

men I interviewed throughout this work but there are important similarities and
important differences that I should mention hoe briefly Perhaps the most remarkable
similarity is how romance novels and pornographic media function as emotional outlets
for their respective audiences The similarity in language is exact both audiences
speak of escape and private time time for me Thus these media give their
audiences an opportunity to withdraw from the demands of everyday life into a fantasy
world where their needs are attended to unconditionally
There are however many differences between these two audiences The social
stigma against pornography for example is much stronger and thus its audience is
extremely atomistic Paradoxically the pornography audience has a great deal of
common knowledge but it is rarely shared among its members although the internet
has changed this to some extent facetoface interaction is I beiieve still rare
Compare the images in Radways study of Dorothy advising her customers on what to
buy and why This never happens in mens pornography culture Radways
description of women readers sitting together and collapsing in laughter about the
experiences of sister readers is difficult to imagine of pornography fans Many though
not ail of the gay men in my sample and a handful of straight men had a community
of friends with whom they could trade and talk pornography but most did not The
extreme social stigma attached to enjoying pornography prevents the creation of
community despite the existence of a common language Although this difference is
profound it does not preclude comparison between the two audiences
This dissertation then is unique in a number of ways It is the only work that
interviews bisexual gay and straight fans of pornography about what their
R e p ro d u c e d with perm ission of th e copyright ow ner F u rth er reproduction prohibited without perm ission

masturbation fantasy and pleasure with pornography means to them and the rote they
see it playing in their lives It treats these men as fens of pornography rather than
users it emphasizes the fact that pornography is a media form a cultural production
and in the language of cultural studies these men are its audience The cultural studies
perspective facilitates a fruitful comparison to women who read romance novels see
Radway  who comprise another stigmatized group of media fans Finally this
study attempts to document a wide diversity of fans and practices and thus it expands the
feminist debates on pornography
B Literature Review
This review is comprised of two areas of study and controversy the pornography
debates and academic research on pornography
 The Pornography Debates
Debates about pornography have been active in this country at least since
Comstocks aggressive and often successful campaign against pornography via the U S
Postal Service in the late s e g Comstock  In this section I will focus on the
current era and briefly outline each of the six positions on pornography listed above
conservative liberal feminist antipomography feminist anticensorship gay men and
marxist
The conservative position is best summarized by the Meese Commissions Final
Report Attorney Generals Commission on Pornography  the Meese Commission
endorsed stronger regulation and stronger enforcement of existing laws Moral outrage
against pornography is central to The Meese Commission To a number of us the most
important harms resulting from pornography must be seen in moral terms and the act of
R e p ro d u c e d with perm ission of th e copyright ow ner F u rth er reproduction prohibited without perm ission

moral condemnation of that which is immoral is not merely important but essential p
 In accord with these arguments the Meese Commission endorses the current legal
definition of obscene  the Supreme Court s decision in  Miller v California
henceforth referred to as the Miller standard upholding a combination of local state
and national standards for the definition and recognition of pornography  One of the
most interesting aspects of The Meese Commission is its use of antipomography
feminist arguments pornography as violence against women to recommend deployment
of lawandorder tactics against pornography Thus they incorporate contemporary
feminist arguments to underwrite a traditional rightwing position The Meese
Commission also solicited a great deal of expert testimony from socialpsychologists who
have conducted research on pornography This strategy may have backfired however
Because The Meese Commission asserted that clinical and experimental research almost
unanimously confirms a causal link between sexual violence in pornography and violent
behavior they have been accused of distorting testimony and current research Linz
Donnersteia and Penrod 
A groups definition of pornography often reveals a great deal about their
position In the case of the liberals the futility of definition is the cornerstone of their
positioa The ACLU delights in what it sees as the impossibility of an accurate definition
of pornography Indeed their position rests on the indeterminacy of pornography that is
the socially constructed historical and cultural grounding of any definition of
pornography Noting that the Supreme Courts  Miller v California decision is still
in effect they insist that no one understands what phrases like the average person
community standards and patently offensive mean ACLU a They dte the U S
R e p ro d u c e d with perm ission of th e copyright ow ner F u rth er reproduction prohibited without perm ission

district judge in Los Angeles who dismissed charges against a pornography distributor
because there was no positive evidence of what the entire community believes in
Clark   Their stance is that standards in a pluralistic society are
impossible to measure Justice Thurgood Marshall summarized the classic civil liberties
position for the ACLU If the First Amendment means anything it means that a state has
no business telling a man sitting alone in his own house what books he may read or
what films he must watch ACLU b
The sexist language used by Justice Marshall falls right into the hands of the
feminists against pornography argument about pornography and the First Amendment
From Dworkin and MacKinnons point of view it is men and men only who have
freedom of speech in our society Pornography and pomographers are protected women
are systematically silenced Dworkin  Their definition of pornography is intrinsic
to their position pornography is the sexually explicit subordination of women
graphically depicted whether in pictures or in words  This definition was taken from
Dworkin and MacKinnons Minneapolis Ordinance hereafter referred to as the
Ordinance whose aim was to empower women by making the production sale
exhibition and distribution of pornography a civil offense Thus it would have allowed
people who were hurt by pornography to sue on the basis of sex discrimination The
basis of the Ordinance was the Civil Rights Act of  which addressed individuals
infringing on the rights of other individuals  The Ordinance attempted to subvert the
Miller standard obscenity law and the liberal First Amendment approach to the issue by
asserting that it is not the speech of men and pomographers that should be protected but
R e p ro d u c e d with perm ission of th e copyright ow ner F u rth er reproduction prohibited without perm ission

society in general and women in particular from pornographys encouragement of
sexual violence e g Russell 
Feminists against censorship are a divase group but their main point is that
cultural productions should not be censored and that it is impossible to distinguish
between permissible erotica and tabooed pornography Willis  response to
Stemems  distinction between pornography and erotica covers these key points
Willis is unmoved by Stemems categorical denunciation of pornography as violence
Willis sees pornography as sexual by definition rather than violent She states that use of
the term erotica is merely a class bias boiling down to what turns me on is erode what
turns you on is pornographic p  The desire for dichotomyerodcapornography
good sexbad sex good girlbad girl good girlbad boy is what Willis objects to most of
all For her such dichotomies are restatements of hackneyed traditional feminine not
feminist patriarchal values
Willis and all the authors in the anticensorship group are in favor of sexual
freedom eg Snitow et al  Ellis et al  Segal and McIntosh X but as
above distinctions can be made among these feminists as well For example there are
feminists who are clearly propornography eg McEIroy  Queen  Sprinkle
 Tisdale  McEIroy  for example lists a number ofbenefits of
pornography political as well as personal She argues that pornography provides images
of women having any and all types of sex without a hint of shame and thus images of
womens sexuality impossible to find elsewhere No sexual question is wrong to ask no
sexual preference is wrong to pursue Pornography is the true arena of tolerance p
 One does not get the same sense of elation about pornography from a number of
R e p ro d u c e d with p erm ission of th e copyright ow ner F u rth er reproduction prohibited without perm ission

ardent antagonists of the antipornography feminist position for example Segal 
Chancer  Strossen  Segal stales pornography embodies the most
outrageous sexist often also racist misogyny That is its function to position women as
 and only as  passive commoditized objects for mens sexual arousaT p 
However she lambastes the antipomography feminist perspective as reductive
behavioristic and dismissive of fantasy
Gay male pornography as an affirmation of hidden desires as speaking the
unspeakable is the overriding theme in gay mens writing about pornography Bronski
 Clark  Preston  Tucker  In a heterosexist culture closeted gay
men find themselves isolated and ashamed of their attraction to other men John Preston
writes that even today when gay culture is stronger than ever before Im still stunned byhow
many people talk about their coming out and describe their feelings that they were
the only ones Pom like any other kind of gay art tells people that they arent alone
 Because they see gay pornography as political some gay writers distance
themselves from straight pornography in response to feminist concerns about sexism e g
Bronski  Preston  Scott Tucker  and Chris Clark  though see
all pornography as desire for sexual freedom and expression of the forbidden and
therefore see basic connections between gay and straight pornography
Alan Sobles  mamst position on pornography is unique Much of his
work is in response to the antipomography feminist perspective attesting to their power
within the debate Soble in fact takes the exact opposite approach as far as men are
concerned Sobles argument is not that men have power and use pornography to keep it
but that they do not have power and use pornography to fantasize about it As opposed to
R e p ro d u c e d with p erm ission of th e copyright ow ner F urther reproduction prohibited without perm ission

the feminist view in which men are unified by gender Soble argues as a marxist that
men are fundamentally divided by class in capitalist society Because male workers are
powerless pornography is an attempt to recoup in the domain of sexual fantasy what is
denied to men in capitalist production 
The positions outlined above by no means possess equal influence in the debates
The antipomography feminist stance has essentially set the stage in the current era The
view of feminists against censorship is a direct reaction to their highprofile court battles
antipornography protests and widely read work Profeminist mens work is always
careful to include it and much of the socialpsychological research makes an effort to
answer questions they pose Although it is likely that antipornography feminists
partnership with the Meese Commission made their position questionable for many on
the left it probably had the opposite effect upon those in the center and on the right
giving the antipomography feminist position cultural and political clout it never had
before In fact the antipomography position is seen as the feminist position by many
Only a few participants in my research for example revealed an understanding of
controversy within feminism over pornography Furthermore the feminists against
pornography have made significant strategic shifts towards addressing pornography as
hate speech since the Ordinance was found unconstitutional For all these reasons I
find rt necessary to present a more detailed account and critique of the antipomography
feminist position
I will begin this discussion with a review of some of the basic arguments
surrounding the early debates I will then establish some of the varied positions inside
what are generally considered two distinct camps I will end by addressing two
R e p ro d u c e d with perm ission of th e copyright ow ner F u rth er reproduction prohibited without perm ission

contemporary developments which seem to result from the Ordinances unconstitutional
status First feminists against pornography have joined hands with critical race theorists
in order to fight pornography and racial slurs as hate speech MacKinnon 
Lederer and Delgado  and second there are a number of new texts seeking to
reconcile the divisions among feminists or reframe the issue in new and creative ways
among others Chancer  Chapkis  Hardy  Juffer  Kipnis 
Williams 
To anyone even marginally familiar with the pornography debate Morgans
epigram Pornography is the theory and rape is the practice   has become
litany Somewhat less familiar but equally dramatic is one of Dworkins final lines in her
book Pornography We will know we are free when the pornography no longer exists
Dworkin   The antipomography feminists take men and pornography very
seriously and not without reason In the truly harrowing accounts presented at the
Minneapolis public hearings MacKinnon and Dworkin  woman after woman told
of her travails at the hands of men with pornography Violence abuse objectification
rape were the consequences of pornography For antipomography feminists all of these
abuses equal the silencing of women These are the roots of their rage toward efforts to
protect pornography and pomographers from censorship Putting a novel twist on the
meaning of sexual freedom Stoltenberg quotes passage after passage of written violent
pornography and asks Wheres the freedom from hatred Wheres the freedom from
degradation Wheres the sexual freedom   For these writers only men
have freedom in this society pornography is not only evidence of the violence that this
society does to women it ts the violence that society does to women It was this
R e p ro d u c e d with perm ission of th e copyright ow ner F u rth er reproduction prohibited without perm ission

assertion that pornography is violence against women which led Dworkin and
MacKinnon to develop the Minneapolis Ordinance discussed above
Although feminists against censorship are sympathetic to the antipomography
feminists concerns about sexual violence and womens subjugation they raise a number
of questions about the antipomography analysis First is pornography really the seat of
mens power Anticensorship feminists consider pornography to be one in a
constellation of problems for women in patriarchal society They argue that analysis of
institutions such as the family work the political structure the economy and the military
cannot be abandoned for the singleissue politics of the antipomography movement
Snitow  has argued that the antipomography perspective is a response to backlash
and feminist frustrations experienced around issues like abortion child care and
tokenism
Second do women and men have essentially different sexualities Echols 
cites Morgan as arguing that
Every woman knows  the vast differences between her sexuality and that of
any patriarchally trained males  EJmphasis on genital sexuality
objectification promiscuity emotional noninvolvement and coarse
invulnerability was the male stye and that we as women placed greater trust in



prostituted her and other women to johns and pornographers Most notoriously of course
she starred in the most financially successful pornography film ever Deep Throai
MacKinnon writes Her experience is on the one hand individually extreme specifically
horrible and unusually brutal and is on the other hand a very common everywoman
kind of experience  p  The brutality of Marchianos early adult  is
documentation of the brutality of some male and female relationships in our society
What these feminists might ask should we be opposing femininity  violence against
women
Marchianos experience ties into a third question raised by feminists
