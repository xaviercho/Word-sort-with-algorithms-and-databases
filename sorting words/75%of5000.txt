sexual preference is wrong to pursue Pornography is the true arena of tolerance p
 One does not get the same sense of elation about pornography from a number of
R e p ro d u c e d with p erm ission of th e copyright ow ner F u rth er reproduction prohibited without perm ission

ardent antagonists of the antipornography feminist position for example Segal 
Chancer  Strossen  Segal stales pornography embodies the most
outrageous sexist often also racist misogyny That is its function to position women as
 and only as  passive commoditized objects for mens sexual arousaT p 
However she lambastes the antipomography feminist perspective as reductive
behavioristic and dismissive of fantasy
Gay male pornography as an affirmation of hidden desires as speaking the
unspeakable is the overriding theme in gay mens writing about pornography Bronski
 Clark  Preston  Tucker  In a heterosexist culture closeted gay
men find themselves isolated and ashamed of their attraction to other men John Preston
writes that even today when gay culture is stronger than ever before Im still stunned byhow
many people talk about their coming out and describe their feelings that they were
the only ones Pom like any other kind of gay art tells people that they arent alone
 Because they see gay pornography as political some gay writers distance
themselves from straight pornography in response to feminist concerns about sexism e g
Bronski  Preston  Scott Tucker  and Chris Clark  though see
all pornography as desire for sexual freedom and expression of the forbidden and
therefore see basic connections between gay and straight pornography
Alan Sobles  mamst position on pornography is unique Much of his
work is in response to the antipomography feminist perspective attesting to their power
within the debate Soble in fact takes the exact opposite approach as far as men are
concerned Sobles argument is not that men have power and use pornography to keep it
but that they do not have power and use pornography to fantasize about it As opposed to
R e p ro d u c e d with p erm ission of th e copyright ow ner F urther reproduction prohibited without perm ission

the feminist view in which men are unified by gender Soble argues as a marxist that
men are fundamentally divided by class in capitalist society Because male workers are
powerless pornography is an attempt to recoup in the domain of sexual fantasy what is
denied to men in capitalist production 
The positions outlined above by no means possess equal influence in the debates
The antipomography feminist stance has essentially set the stage in the current era The
view of feminists against censorship is a direct reaction to their highprofile court battles
antipornography protests and widely read work Profeminist mens work is always
careful to include it and much of the socialpsychological research makes an effort to
answer questions they pose Although it is likely that antipornography feminists
partnership with the Meese Commission made their position questionable for many on
the left it probably had the opposite effect upon those in the center and on the right
giving the antipomography feminist position cultural and political clout it never had
before In fact the antipomography position is seen as the feminist position by many
Only a few participants in my research for example revealed an understanding of
controversy within feminism over pornography Furthermore the feminists against
pornography have made significant strategic shifts towards addressing pornography as
hate speech since the Ordinance was found unconstitutional For all these reasons I
find rt necessary to present a more detailed account and critique of the antipomography
feminist position
I will begin this discussion with a review of some of the basic arguments
surrounding the early debates I will then establish some of the varied positions inside
what are generally considered two distinct camps I will end by addressing two
R e p ro d u c e d with perm ission of th e copyright ow ner F u rth er reproduction prohibited without perm ission

contemporary developments which seem to result from the Ordinances unconstitutional
status First feminists against pornography have joined hands with critical race theorists
in order to fight pornography and racial slurs as hate speech MacKinnon 
Lederer and Delgado  and second there are a number of new texts seeking to
reconcile the divisions among feminists or reframe the issue in new and creative ways
among others Chancer  Chapkis  Hardy  Juffer  Kipnis 
Williams 
To anyone even marginally familiar with the pornography debate Morgans
epigram Pornography is the theory and rape is the practice   has become
litany Somewhat less familiar but equally dramatic is one of Dworkins final lines in her
book Pornography We will know we are free when the pornography no longer exists
Dworkin   The antipomography feminists take men and pornography very
seriously and not without reason In the truly harrowing accounts presented at the
Minneapolis public hearings MacKinnon and Dworkin  woman after woman told
of her travails at the hands of men with pornography Violence abuse objectification
rape were the consequences of pornography For antipomography feminists all of these
abuses equal the silencing of women These are the roots of their rage toward efforts to
protect pornography and pomographers from censorship Putting a novel twist on the
meaning of sexual freedom Stoltenberg quotes passage after passage of written violent
pornography and asks Wheres the freedom from hatred Wheres the freedom from
degradation Wheres the sexual freedom   For these writers only men
have freedom in this society pornography is not only evidence of the violence that this
society does to women it ts the violence that society does to women It was this
R e p ro d u c e d with perm ission of th e copyright ow ner F u rth er reproduction prohibited without perm ission

assertion that pornography is violence against women which led Dworkin and
MacKinnon to develop the Minneapolis Ordinance discussed above
Although feminists against censorship are sympathetic to the antipomography
feminists concerns about sexual violence and womens subjugation they raise a number
of questions about the antipomography analysis First is pornography really the seat of
mens power Anticensorship feminists consider pornography to be one in a
constellation of problems for women in patriarchal society They argue that analysis of
institutions such as the family work the political structure the economy and the military
cannot be abandoned for the singleissue politics of the antipomography movement
Snitow  has argued that the antipomography perspective is a response to backlash
and feminist frustrations experienced around issues like abortion child care and
tokenism
Second do women and men have essentially different sexualities Echols 
cites Morgan as arguing that
Every woman knows  the vast differences between her sexuality and that of
any patriarchally trained males  EJmphasis on genital sexuality
objectification promiscuity emotional noninvolvement and coarse
invulnerability was the male stye and that we as women placed greater trust in



prostituted her and other women to johns and pornographers Most notoriously of course
she starred in the most financially successful pornography film ever Deep Throai
MacKinnon writes Her experience is on the one hand individually extreme specifically
horrible and unusually brutal and is on the other hand a very common everywoman
kind of experience  p  The brutality of Marchianos early adult  is
documentation of the brutality of some male and female relationships in our society
What these feminists might ask should we be opposing femininity  violence against
women
Marchianos experience ties into a third question raised by feminists
