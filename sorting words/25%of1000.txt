The study has been designed to le t the hypothesis that current discourse and
research on pornography does not represent mens experiences of pornography The
pornography controversy has generated a massive literature by any standard Scholars
activists and politicians have looked at pornography and theorized Brod

been no serious attempt to talk to men in detail  to understand  in die classic Weberian
 sense of Verstehen  what pornography means to them and the roles they see it
playing in their lives  The only works that come close are Winick and Hardy
 Winick  interviewed porn fans for the  Commission on Obscenity
and Pornography  Thai report addresses some important issues which will be discussed
later  but besides being sorely out of date it is lacking in detail as the researcher did
not identify himself as such  The interview was therefore masked as a one time casual
conversation  Hardy s study is limited m a number of basic ways  and a more
detailed critique of his work appears later in this chapter Briefly  however  Hardy is
primarily interested in the problematics of heterosexual desire so his sample of  men
includes no bisexuals or gays Furthermore  the study was conducted in Britain where
hardcore pornography is prohibited  thus  it addresses only softcore pornographic writing
It is questionably applicable to U S  fans Finally  Hardy is cnpplingly conservative
about gender and sexuality He repeatedly insists  despite a great deal of evidence  that
women do not like and do not produce pornography
Plainly  there has been much discussion of pornography  yet few attempts to
understand what men are really doing when they masturbate with pornography  What
is more the strongest voices at present are those of condemnation  in particular 
government commissions  policies and anti pornography feminists  Indeed  my
interviews indicate that such stereotypes as the trench  coated lonely man at the
pornography house are alive and well  Pornography and men are still shrouded in a
son of ironic mystery  continually talked about  yet continually unknown HOne of the

central goals of the study is so demystify and debunk mens experience of pornography
and to document what  believe to be die difference and variety of experiences among
these men Thus it was conducted with focused openended indepth qualitative
interviews with men who answered advertisements requesting participation in research
on pornography
One of the studys guides is profeminist mens studies The mens studies
approach though in its fledgling stages promotes the study of men selfconsciously as
men Men are no longer the objective representatives of humanity Brod b they
are gendered actors acting within the frame of masculine agendas By definition then
mens identification with or resistance to particular masculinities and the social
construction of those masculinities become the central focus of any study of men Like
womens studies before it the purpose of mens studies is to reveal aspects of history
and experience that have previously been hidden from study History hidden not
because of secondclass status as in the case of women but precisely because of mens
firstclass status As firstclass citizens as the nonOther as the writers of history
and social science men have unselfconsciously
